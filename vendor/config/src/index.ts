   * and the keeper reported it as "cannot read health on NVDA" — a market problem, not a deploy
   * problem. It read that way for as long as it took to trace by hand.

   * Two things stop it recurring, and neither is vigilance: `Lens`'s constructor now rejects an
   * address with no code, and `script/DeployLens.s.sol` takes the address from
